### CI/CD using AWS for Node.js
-	AWS tools which we'll use are
	-	CodeBuild
	-	Elastic Beanstalk
	-	CodePipeline
-	Source code can be integrated using Git
-	CodeBuild can be used for building the code and VPC has to be configured if there are any dependency on services
	-   Because codebuild happens in a different VPC
-	Elastic Beanstalk can be used to deploy the application.
    -   Environment variables can be used
	-	```NODE_ENV=production``` => env variable helps to execute the => npm inistall
-	First a CodeBuild project have to be created and mention the source code(i.e., git or CodeCommit)
	-	```buildspec.yml``` has to be added to Node.js project
	-	env variables can be configured
	-	The logs can be streamed to cloudwatch
	-	After configuring we can run a build
-	Secondly create a Beanstalk application & environment for sample Node.js code
	-	Configure to have High Availability because otherwise by default it'll create a server and attach a Elastic IP
	-	We can configure different type of deployments
	-	Prefer rolling update than all at once
-	Finally create a CodePipeline, 
	-	configure the source as Git, 
	-	add a build stage and configure CodeBuild project which was created
	-	add a deploy stage and configure to Elastic Beanstalk application & environment which were created
-	We can access the application using Load balancer's DNS/Elastic Beanstalk DNS
